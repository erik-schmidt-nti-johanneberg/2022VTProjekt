                    Erik started his life in Kärra, a small community a bit outside Gothenburg. As a young child he
                    studied at Kärraskolan for about 15 years but he'd rather not think about that time. After
                    graduating from Kärraskolan he applied for NTI Johanneberg where he still studies to this day as a
                    design student because he's only 17 going on 18. But his interest in photography started around the
                    age of 14 and a year later he got his first very own camera. As he's studying at NTI Johanneberg his
                    interest still grows and intrigues him further. What he'll do after graduation is up for debate as
                    he yet has to decide what he wants do to with his life.

                    A picture of Erik and one of his associates, DaVinky the rat. DaVinky has a brother but he's not
                    showed in any pictures because he is a bastard named Deonardo. Their names are a spin on Leonado
                    DaVinci's name and Erik just thought it'd be fun to name them that.
